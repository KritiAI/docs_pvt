# WARP testing engine

This is a unique feature only available to Kriti AI creators.

WARP testing engine is a powerful buildout tool, which allows rapid testing of steps in the conversation flow. This works if at least 1 facebook page is attached to the UX model being tested. There are 2 steps to this:

1. Click on the "WARP ⚡" button on the top of the page. It will show a popup with two dropdowns. Select the facebook page and and your name from the two dropdowns
2. To test a specific step in the flow click on the "⚡" button in front of the flow. It will trigger that specific step in a contextually aware manner. Then you can provide your input in the messenger chat window to see how your custom backend logic processes the input. 

Thus with a single click on the WARP button of any element, the Kriti AI SEAM engine will automatically navigate the conversational flow, its various contexts and enable you to test that specific step in a contextually aware manner.
